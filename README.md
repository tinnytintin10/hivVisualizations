# 248 Group Project: Mental health and its association with HIV

`jsonC.py` Is a scrip that will parse through the JSON data on HIV and Mental Health we got from [WHO](https://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.imr#ndx-H). Once JSON data has been parsed, it will get shipped by Filebeat to Elasticsearch. We will use Kibana on top of ES to build some of our visualizations.
